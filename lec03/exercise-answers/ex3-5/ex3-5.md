# Exercise 3-5: reverse.c

We are tasked to make a program that takes user input and reverses the string. There are many approaches that we can take for this problem, but a simple way to do this is to just to swap the characters in the string until we reach the middle point. This way we don't have to allocate memory for another string, we just need to allocate memory for 1 `char` to temporary store the character for later use.
